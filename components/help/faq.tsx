        <AccordionItem value="migration-failed">
          <AccordionTrigger>What should I do if a migration fails?</AccordionTrigger>
          <AccordionContent>
            <p>If a migration fails, follow these steps:</p>
            <ol className="list-decimal pl-5 mt-2 space-y-1">
              <li>Check the console logs for error details.</li>
              <li>Fix the issues in the migration script.</li>
              <li>
                If the database is in an inconsistent state, use the rollback feature to revert to the previous state.
              </li>
              <li>For complex failures, you may need to restore from a backup.</li>
              <li>Once fixed, try running the migration again.</li>

        <AccordionItem value="data-loss">
          <AccordionTrigger>Can migrations cause data loss?</AccordionTrigger>
          <AccordionContent>
            <p>
              Yes, certain migration operations like dropping tables or columns can cause data loss. To minimize risks:
            </p>
            <ul className="list-disc pl-5 mt-2 space-y-1">
              <li>Always back up your database before running migrations in production.</li>
              <li>Use the &quot;Dry Run&quot; feature to preview changes before executing them.</li>
              <li>Write careful down migrations that preserve data when possible.</li>
              <li>
                For schema changes that might affect data, consider using multiple migrations with intermediate steps.

        <AccordionItem value="version-control">
          <AccordionTrigger>How does DB Migrator work with version control?</AccordionTrigger>
          <AccordionContent>
            <p>DB Migrator works well with version control systems like Git:</p>
            <ul className="list-disc pl-5 mt-2 space-y-1">
              <li>Migration scripts can be stored in your repository alongside your application code.</li>
              <li>The migration metadata is stored in a special table in your database.</li>
              <li>This allows team members to track which migrations have been applied to each environment.</li>
              <li>
                We recommend committing migration scripts to version control before applying them to any environment.
              </li>
            </ul>

            <ul className="list-disc pl-5 mt-2 space-y-1">
              <li>Store migration scripts in version control.</li>

              <li>Review migrations before applying them to shared environments.</li>
              <li>Use the &quot;author&quot; field to track who created each migration.</li>
              <li>Consider setting up a CI/CD pipeline to automatically apply migrations during deployments.</li>

              <li>Break them down into smaller, focused migrations when possible.</li>
              <li>Use transactions to ensure atomicity (all or nothing).</li>
              <li>Consider running data-intensive migrations during off-peak hours.</li>
              <li>For very large data operations, consider using database-native tools or batch processing.</li>
